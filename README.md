**1.** Go to the github repository link

**2.** Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/CodingEasy
```

**3.** Navigate to the new project directory:

```bash
cd CodingEasy
```

**4.** Set upstream command:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/arpit456jain/CodingEasy.git
```

**5.** Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b YourBranchName
```

**6.** Sync your local repository with the origin repository:

- In your forked repository click on "Fetch upstream"
- Click "Fetch and merge".

### Alternatively, Git CLI way to Sync forked repository with origin repository:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

```bash
git merge upstream/main
```

## Project Setup

virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments. Since Python 3.3, a subset of it has been integrated into the standard library under the venv module. The venv module does not offer all features of this library, to name just a few more prominent:

- is slower (by not having the app-data seed method),
- is not as extendable,
- cannot create virtual environments for arbitrarily installed python versions (and automatically discover these),
- is not upgrade-able via pip,
- does not have as rich programmatic API (describe virtual environments without creating them).

**1. Create a Virtual Environment**

- *On macOS and Linux:*
  ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
  ```
- *Windows*
  ```bash
    py -m venv env
  ````

**2. Activate the Virtual Environment**
  - *On Windows*
    ```bash
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - *On macOS and Linux:*
    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```
**3. Install dependencies using**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Make Migrations**

```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
```
**5. Run Server**

```bash
  python manage.py runserver
```
**6. Create admin**

```bash
  python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Congratulations! You've created your virtual environment.
